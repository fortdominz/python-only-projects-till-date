# 🎓 Dominion Eze's Python Project Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains a curated collection of Python mini-projects developed from hands-on practice and personal curiosity. Many of these projects explore object-oriented programming (OOP), CLI design, algorithmic logic, and creative uses of modules like `turtle` and `random`.

## 📁 What's Inside

| Project                          | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Coffee Machine App (OOP)**     | Simulates a virtual coffee machine using class-based modular components (`Menu`, `CoffeeMaker`, `MoneyMachine`) |
| **ATM Simulation (CLI)** | Simulates basic ATM functionality, with balance management, withdrawals, and secure input logic |
| **Quiz Game (OOP)**              | Terminal-based quiz program pulling questions from a data file, with encapsulated logic for question models and scoring |
| **Snake Game (OOP + Turtle)**    | Classic Snake game built with `turtle` graphics; uses custom classes for snake, food, and scoreboard behaviors |
| **Hirst Spot Painting (Art Project)** | Recreates Damien Hirst's dotted artwork using turtle graphics and color palette extraction from images |
| **Tip Calculator (CLI)**   | Basic command-line applications simulating banking functionality and everyday calculators |
| **Guessing Games, Blackjack, Hangman** | A suite of interactive terminal games showcasing randomization, control flow, and clean logic |
| **Higher/Lower Comparison Game** | Mimics the popular “higher or lower” challenge using Python dictionaries and custom modules |
| **Etch-A-Sketch (Turtle Drawing App)** | Use arrow keys to draw with Python's turtle module — clear and control the screen with keybindings |

And many more! See the full file list for additional CLI challenges and logic-based practice tasks.

## 🧰 Tools & Concepts Used

- **Languages:** Python
- **Paradigms:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Modular Design
- **Techniques:** File I/O, Terminal-based interactivity, List/Dict manipulations
- **Libraries:** `turtle`, `random`, `os`, `time`, `colorgram.py` (for color extraction)
- **Environments:** PyCharm, Git, GitHub

## 🔭 Goals

These projects serve as a foundation for my continued growth as a future DevOps Engineer and Software Developer. Each project reflects a milestone in understanding logic design, clean code practices, and practical Python application.
